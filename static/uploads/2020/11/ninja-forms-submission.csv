"143","20/11/2020","M Lane Construction","Beverly","Lane","Truck Repair","Our 1999 Chevy 3500 Utility Truck was rear-ended. As a result, the rear step bump completely caved downward and broke off from where it was bolted under the bed flap. One of the utility boxes has a dent which may need to be pulled out. The other vehicle forced our truck into another vehicle, and front chrome bumper is misaligned and dented.  The vehicle is vinyl wrapped.  Hoping you can provide a quote and perform the repair.
