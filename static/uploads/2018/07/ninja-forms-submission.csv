Michael worked on my  2003  EuroVan  a few months ago.  He did a great job .  He disconnected my refrigerator in hopes that 
That would stop the shorting  out of the 
Auxiliary battery .  Well,  it didn’t  do the trick! I am taking the EuroVan to Burningman on aug. 25.   I return home from Europe on aug 20.   Can I make an appt.  now for aug. 21 at 11 am to bring it in?  Can you schedule Michael  to check over all the electrical & hopefull find the problem why the new  auxiliary battery is  not holding a charge?   
Thanks so much for your great service!   I love working with you all.  
 Just e mail me back .  My phone doesn’t Work in Europe.  
Regards,   Elizabeth Bechtold. "
